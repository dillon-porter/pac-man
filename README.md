# pac-man

This project was developed by Scrimba during Module #6

A pac-man game built in JavaScript, HTML and CSS

DEMO: https://dillon-porter.github.io/pac-man/

Description: Use the arrow keys to collect the green squares to add a score. Once you get to 274 you win! If you get eaten by a ghost you lose!

Apart from Scrimba, I changed the background color of the grid, and some ghost colors. I also added a button to play again after you win or lose as that was not part of project. Once clicked the game fully resets.

Some JavaScript functions that we used are:

- addEventListener()
- getElementById()
- querySelector()
- for Loop
- appendChild()
- createElement()
- push()
- if else statements
- classList
- switch case
- keyCode
- forEach()
- setTimeout
- Class
- constructor
- setInterval()
- removeEventListener
